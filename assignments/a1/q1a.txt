I had this version of a requester but it's more contrived than the aio version, because you can just put 'thread.wait()' and the thing will work.

import http.client
import threading
import time

def retriever():
    global result
    result = ''
    connection = http.client.HTTPSConnection('git.uwaterloo.ca')
    connection.request("GET", "/")
    response = connection.getresponse()
    contents = response.read()
    result = contents.decode('utf-8', 'ignore')

def network_retrieve():
    """
    Issue  python -m doctest thisfile.py  to run the doctests.

    >>> print(network_retrieve())
    <html><body>You are being <a href="https://git.uwaterloo.ca/users/sign_in">redirected</a>.</body></html>
    """
    thread = threading.Thread(target=retriever)
    thread.start()
    time.sleep(10)
    return result
